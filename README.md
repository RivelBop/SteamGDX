# SteamGDX
A basic Steam library built in Java using the steamworks4j library for LibGDX.

The purpose of this library is to make it a lot easier to implement Steam into Java games. This library is able to be used on any Java game engine but please keep in mind
that the main purpose of this library is to be used with LibGDX.

You are free to use this library all you want but it would be nice if you could credit it!
