# SteamGDX
A basic Steam library built in Java using the steamworks4j library for LibGDX.

The purpose of this library is to make it a lot easier to implement Steam into Java games. This library is able to be used on any Java game engine but please keep in mind
that the main purpose of this library is to be used with LibGDX.

TO USE THE LIBRARY WITH LIBGDX:
Simply download the source code and put it into your project. The SteamGDX folder is only an example/test of how you can use the library, you do not need to copy over this package/folder.

TO USE THE LIBRARY WITHOUT LIBGDX:
Do the same steps as explained above, make sure to replace all the GDX methods/calls with the calls that are associated with the engine you are using.

You are free to use this library all you want but it would be nice if you could credit it!
